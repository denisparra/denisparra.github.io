<b>September 2016</b> I attended the ACM RecSys 2016 conference in Boston, USA. In collaboration with Dr. Chris Trattner, we presented "<b><a href="./pdfs/WeatherPOI-RecSys2016-v2.pdf">Understanding the Impact of Weather for POI Recommendations</a></b>." In another collaboration, led by Prof. Katrien Verbert, we presented "<b><a href="./pdfs/IntRS-recsys-2016.pdf">Scalable Exploration of Relevance Prospects to Support Decision Making</a></b>." I also co-organized the Large-Scale Recsys Workshop with Tao Ye (Pandora) and Danny Bickson (Dato) <a href="http://conf.turi.com/lsrs16/agenda/">Slides here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>August 2016</b> Second term starting at PUC Chile! Don't miss the <a href="https://github.com/PUC-SocVis/DataScience-Day1">Data Science Day 1, tools for information visualization.</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>July 2016</b> I attended the UMAP 2016 conference in Halifax, Canada. In addition to presenting our paper "<a  target="_blank"  href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2930280">Moodplay: Interactive Mood-based Music Discovery and Recommendation</a>", I gave an invited talk at the <a  target="_blank" href="ifup2016.luckymoon.me">IFUP Workshop</a>, titled "<i>Data Fusion for Dealing with the Recommendation Problem</i>", <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/denisparra/data-fusion-for-dealing-with-the-recommendation-problem">slides here</a>. I also gave another invited talk at the <a sitio target="_blank" href="https://futurepd.wordpress.com/schedule/">FuturePD workshop</a> about ways to expand our Moodplay system with respect to the emotional context.
</p>
<p>

<b>May 2016</b> Our first article on the Moodplay system (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M6TSKg9YfI">link to demo video</a>), a music artists' recommender system based on emotions, was accepted at the UMAP 2016 conference. This is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~ivana/">Ivana Andjelkovic</a> and <a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~jod/">John O'Donovan</a> from University of California, Santa Barbara. In addition, online media in Chile has covered our work such as <a href="http://www.emol.com/noticias/Tecnologia/2016/05/09/801858/Ingenieros-chilenos-crean-aplicacion-que-sugiere-musica-segun-el-estado-de-animo.html">EMOL</a>, <a href="http://www.latercera.com/noticia/tendencias/2016/05/659-679942-9-chilenos-crean-aplicacion-que-recomienda-canciones-segun-tu-estado-de-animo.shtml">La Tercera</a>, <a href="https://www.df.cl/noticias/tendencias/tecnologia/ingenieros-uc-crean-app-que-recomienda-canciones-segun-estado-de-animo/2016-05-09/202716.html">Diario Financiero</a>, and I have also given some interviews to radio stations such as BioBio, <a href="http://t13radio.cl/radio/#1462975610">Tele13</a> and Rock & Pop. Read the <a href="http://www.ing.uc.cl/ingenieros-crean-aplicacion-que-recomienda-canciones-segun-250-estados-de-animo/">official news</a> released by the School of Engineering at PUC about this project.

<p>

<b>January 2016</b> From January 9th to February 6th I'll be visiting the University of Notre Dame (IN) as guest assistant professor to work on topics of Information Visualization and Recommender Systems with Professor <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~cwang11/about.html">Chaoli Wang</a>. I am really excited about this collaboration and for visiting the US again after finishing my PhD in 2013 in Pittsburgh.
</p>

<p>

<b>November 2015</b> I gave a talk on Recommender Systems in the <a href="http://www.startechconf.com/">StarTechConf</a>, very interesting since the public is made mostly of software developers so the typical academic talk won't fit in. I also gave a talk at the <a href="https://twitter.com/centroisci/status/663708602536955904 " >research seminar of the Institute for Complex Systems in Engineering</a> at University of Chile, thanks to <a href="http://www.dii.uchile.cl/author/weber/">Richard Weber</a> for the invitation.

</p>

<p>
<b>September 2015</b> Attended the ACM RecSys 2015 Conference. We presented 2 short papers and one poster. The papers were about Time-aware collaborative filtering [<a href="./pdfs/Larrain_Parra_etal_RecSys_2015_Time_in_TagBased_RecSys.pdf">pre-print pdf</a>], and a study of whether data from virtual worlds can help us make recommendations on the real world for LBSN [<a href="./pdfs/Parra-Marinho-Trattner-Recsys2015-VirtualWorlds-LBSN-preprint.pdf">pre-print pdf</a>]. The poster was in different area, we studied a way of generalizing the SLIM recommendation model, a state-of-the-art sparse model for matrix factorization [<a href="http://web.ing.puc.cl/~dparra/pdfs/Improving_SLIM_Recommendation.pdf">pre-print pdf</a>]. The best news was that our collaborator Leandro Balby-Marinho won the best paper award for the article [<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2800187">Context-Aware Event Recommendation in Event-based Social Networks
</a>]
</p>


<p>
<b>August 2015</b> In addition to the 2 short papers accepted at ACM RecSys, we have a poster in collaboration with the <a target="_blank" href="http://grima.ing.puc.cl/">PUC GRIMA group</a>: "Towards Improving Top-N Recommendation by
Generalization of SLIM" [<a href="http://web.ing.puc.cl/~dparra/pdfs/Improving_SLIM_Recommendation.pdf">pre-print pdf</a>]. I am also co-organizing the <a href="http://socialcomputing.ing.puc.cl/sps2015/" target="_blank">Workshop on Social Computing and Personalization</a>, co-located at ACM SIGIR 2015, which will be held in August 13th in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.cl/maps?q=Centro+de+Extensi%C3%B3n+Universidad+Cat%C3%B3lica,+Santiago&hl=es&ie=UTF8&ll=-33.44133,-70.641301&spn=0.002587,0.006099&sll=-33.441532,-70.641124&sspn=0.001294,0.00305&oq=Centro+de+Exte&hq=Centro+de+Extensi%C3%B3n+Universidad+Cat%C3%B3lica,+Santiago&t=m&z=18">Centro de Extensión at PUC Chile</a>. This month is also starting the Spring term in PUC Chile (Aug-Dec), where I am teaching the Exploratory Course of the Major in Computer Science and the graduate course in <a href="http://web.ing.puc.cl/~dparra/classes/recsys-2015-2/index.html">Recommender Systems, IIC 3633, 2015</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>July 2015</b> The hard work of the last year paid off and we have two papers accepted at the ACM RecSys 2015 conference.  "Good Times Bad Times: A Study on Recency Effects in Collaborative Filtering for Social Tagging"[<a href="./pdfs/Larrain_Parra_etal_RecSys_2015_Time_in_TagBased_RecSys.pdf">pre-print pdf</a>] and "Are Real-World Place Recommender Algorithms Useful in Virtual World Environments?" [<a href="./pdfs/Parra-Marinho-Trattner-Recsys2015-VirtualWorlds-LBSN-preprint.pdf">pre-print pdf</a>]. See more details in our <a href="http://socialcomputing.ing.puc.cl">SocVis research group web site</a>.
